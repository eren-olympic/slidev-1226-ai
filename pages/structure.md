1. Hello World
2. What is Generative AI?
    1. Harvard And BCG
        - 12.2% more tasks

    2. AI democratized in every product
        - YOUR AI built on YOUR DATA is what will set you apart
        - Why build your own model?
            - Control
            - Privacy
            - Cost
5. How do you build end-to-end AI applications?
    - How can I compete in an AI world?
        - Modeling techniques quickly commoditize
            - SaaS LLM models prices dropping exponentially
            - High quality open-source models now available
        - your data is your competitive advantage
